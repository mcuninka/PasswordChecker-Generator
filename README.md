## Setup
In order to run the **server**, you must have python installed on your machine, together with requests and flask libraries

`pip install requests`

`pip install flask` 

For the **client**, make sure to have **npm** installed on your computer.

To start the application, navigate yourself to the flask_server directory (`cd flask_server`) and start the server by executing `python3 main.py`.

Afterwards in the different terminal, navigate yourself to the client directory (`cd client`) and run ‘npm start’. Before running the client, run `npm ci` or `npm i` to install all necessary node modules. Once you have all node modules, you do not have to run these commands again and you can just start the client with `npm start`.
