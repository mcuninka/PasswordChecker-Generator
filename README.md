# PasswordChecker-Generator
Web application to check password complexity and to generate weak/strong passwords

## Setup
I have created a single page web application, Python with flask was used for the backend and React JS for the frontend. In order to run the server, you must have python installed on your machine, together with requests and flask libraries (pip install requests & pip install flask). For the client, make sure to have npm installed on your computer.
	To start the application, navigate yourself to the flask_server directory (cd flask_server) and start the server by executing ‘python3 main.py’. Afterwards in the differ-ent terminal, navigate yourself to the client directory (cd client) and run ‘npm start’. Before running the client, run npm ci or npm i to install all necessary node modules. Once you have all node modules, you do not have to run these commands again and you can just start the client with ‘npm start’.
